This repository contains a small static website created for an assignment. The goal of the project is simply to show some of the things I’ve been learning, including basic cybersecurity concepts, system administration tasks, and a few simple projects related to network monitoring and system hardening. The site is published using GitHub Pages. The structure includes an index page, several subpages for the different projects, a short about section, and a basic contact form. The main page gives a quick introduction and links to a couple of the projects, such as a defensive security framework and a simple network traffic analyzer. 
The about page explains a bit of my background and what I’m studying. The projects section includes short descriptions of the exercises I worked on, why I did them, and what tools or ideas they use. The contact page just has a small form for anyone who wants to send a message. 
The website is built using HTML and CSS, and organized as a multi‑page layout. It’s mainly meant as practice and as a place to keep track of what I’m learning. If you want to see it online, it’s available through GitHub Pages, and the full code is in this repository.
